ML Paper Writing: Best practice

results should show actual accuracy obtained!
comparison of methods in terms of cost function was bollocks - accuracy is everything

do not tell everything you tried, only the most relevant. show result even proving that it is worse.
dont tell that you tried sth but it didn't work - its just as if you didn't do it


Test data is supposed to be normalized the same way as train!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Normalization of test data = (test data  - mean_of_TRAIN_data) / standard_deviation_of_TRAIN_data
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

in practical case what you should do is:
take features -> calculate polynomial features -> normalize

or

take features -> normalize -> calculate polynomial features -> normalize



CROSS-VALIDATION
mean AND standard deviation! (boxplot)


Error measure gotta make sense!
pure accuracy was not a good error measure because you could set all y to 0 and get 90% accuracy!
better would be to calculate false possitive/false negative accuracy rate 'how health your model is'

IF Run.py runs too long just save weights in file

MODULARIZE CODE
